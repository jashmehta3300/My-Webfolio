# Unicode-project

**This file contains the following two projects:**

1)**WEBFOLIO**

This website compromises of multiple web pages namely:
<br>Home
<br>About me
<br>Education
<br>Skills
<br>Employment history
<br>Hobbies

I have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Vanilla Java Script for making this project. 
Education tab was made mobile responsive using Bootstrap.
Media query is used in all the tabs to make the navigation bar vanish.
I have made use of responsive flip-cards, responsive buttons, business card and full screen image slider.
A top navigation bar is present on all the websites along with a side-bar which appears on clicking the symbol on the top of the screen.
Java script is used to activate the side-bar only.


2)**Sign-in and sign-up page**

This page has a sign-in and sign-up page with an attractive animation to switch between the two. I have used HTML, CSS and Vanilla Java Script for making this project.

**Sign-up**
<br>*Form validation* - The email-id, password and mobile number entered is checked and if it is incorrect then an alert appears.
<br>*Storing the entered data* - Once submit button is pressed, the entered email-id and password is saved in the local storage.

**Sign-in**
<br>*checking the entered details* - If the email-id and password entered match, then alert appears saying that login is successful. If the details entered do not match with that entered in the sign-up form then an alert appears saing that logic is unsuccessful.
